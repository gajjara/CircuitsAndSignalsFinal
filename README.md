# CircuitsAndSignalsFinal
The MATLAB code and .mat file for my Circuits and Signals Final.

The .mat file is an example ECG signal, and the .m file is the complete MatLab file.

See <a href="https://gajjara.github.io/circuits_final">my portfolio page</a> on this project.

Credit goes to the Circuits and Signals teaching faculty of the 2019 Fall Semester at Northeastern University,
and my lab partner for the Fall 2019 class.
